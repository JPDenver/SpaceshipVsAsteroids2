# SpaceshipVsAsteroids2
A game where you have to destroy asteroids with your spaceship

This is a game I made using the pygame module. The goal is to keep the asteroids from getting past you by shooting lasers at them from your spaceship. 
A few interesting things happen like the numbers of asteroids increasing at certain points in the game so it becomes increasingly harder.
